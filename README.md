# Personal Portfolio
### Video Demo:  <https://vimeo.com/781575931>
#### The project includes two webpages, an example of animations, and was focused on HTML and CSS.

## Technologies used:

Hostinger Web Hosting
Formsubmit
Adobe Fonts
bcryptjs
HTML
CSS stylsheet
other small libraries or packages

## How does it work?
You can click on links to external pages, links to certain sections, and send messages with the contact form.

## Additional Information

I started by finding a hosting provider and registering a domain name.

With VS code I created the main page, adding in different sections with HTML and stylizing those with CSS. This includes a header, footer, body, social media icons, and a menu navigation. I added an animation to the hero section. The contact form took me the longest amount of time, because although I upgraded my account after starting this project I haven't been able to integrate Javascript or PHP without errors that I need to solve with the hosting provider, so this provided another challenge to figure out how a message can be emailed to me using on HTML. I figured out how to use Form Submit to have a message forwarded.

## Possible improvements

I see a great deal of opporunities for improvement, staring with getting access to adding in Javascript and other coding languages to make it more interesting and adding some layers of complexity. I would like to have more animations, hover changes, more stylized effects, and more style overall. Maybe also adding a menu with more external pages or to link to other sections.
